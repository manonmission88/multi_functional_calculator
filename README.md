# multi_functional_calculator
 
 
 This is my first project made by Using Python GUI . 
 Although , the project is not unique , the knowledge I applied for this project is very new to me . 
 When I started learning python,I didnot know Python can be used for GUI and I was curious to learn how Python GUI would look like . 
 Then I started learning tkinter library and able to built a simple multifunctional calculator . 
 
 In this calculator , you would be able to perform factorization and permutation and many more features which might be new in smart calculator . 
 In coming days , I would try to add more features on it as I am a math enthusiast would love to see my calcuator having a lot of features which we 
use in school/college life . 

 
 special thanks to CODE WITH HARRY youtube channel where I learned a lot about Python . 
 I would recommend to follow him .
